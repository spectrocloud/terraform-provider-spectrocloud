### Dev build of providers

Dev providers can be generated by running script `generate_dev_provider.sh` or by running `make dev-provider`.

Optionally, provider version can also be passed while generating provider by running script with provider version as arg like `generate_dev_provider.sh 7.7.0` or by running `make DEV_PROVIDER_VERSION=7.7.0 dev-provider`.
