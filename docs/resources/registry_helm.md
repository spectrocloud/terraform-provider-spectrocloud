# spectrocloud_registry_helm (Resource)

  

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "spectrocloud_registry_helm" "r1" {
  name       = "us-artifactory"
  endpoint   = "https://123456.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com"
  is_private = true
  credentials {
    credential_type = "noAuth"
    username        = "abc"
    password        = "def"
  }
  # Optional: Wait for the registry to complete synchronization
  # wait_for_sync = true
}
```

## Import

Helm registries can be imported using the registry ID. This is a tenant-level resource.

```bash
terraform import spectrocloud_registry_helm.example <registry_id>
```

Where `<registry_id>` is the Helm registry ID.

The import will automatically populate all configuration fields from the Spectro Cloud API, including the name, endpoint, privacy setting, and authentication credentials. After import, you can run `terraform plan` to see the current configuration and make any necessary adjustments.

**Note**: Since this is a tenant-level resource, ensure your provider is configured with appropriate tenant-level credentials and access.
