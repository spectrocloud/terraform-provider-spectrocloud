# spectrocloud_registry_oci (Resource)

  

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "spectrocloud_registry_oci" "r1" {
  name       = "test-nik2"
  type       = "ecr" # basic
  endpoint   = "123456.dkr.ecr.us-west-1.amazonaws.com"
  is_private = true
  credentials {
    credential_type = "sts"
    arn             = "arn:aws:iam::123456:role/stage-demo-ecr"
    external_id     = "sofiwhgowbrgiornM="
  }
}
```

## Import

OCI registries can be imported using the registry ID. This is a tenant-level resource.

```bash
terraform import spectrocloud_registry_oci.example <registry_id>
```

Where `<registry_id>` is the OCI registry ID.

The import will automatically detect whether the registry is an ECR or basic type and populate all configuration fields from the Spectro Cloud API. After import, you can run `terraform plan` to see the current configuration and make any necessary adjustments.

**Note**: Since this is a tenant-level resource, ensure your provider is configured with appropriate tenant-level credentials and access.

## Schema

### Required

- `credentials` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) Authentication credentials to access the private OCI registry. Required if `is_private` is set to `true` (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--credentials))
- `endpoint` (String) The URL endpoint of the OCI registry. This is where the container images are hosted and accessed.
- `is_private` (Boolean) Specifies whether the registry is private or public. Private registries require authentication to access.
- `name` (String) The name of the OCI registry.
- `type` (String) The type of the registry. Possible values are 'ecr' (Amazon Elastic Container Registry) or 'basic' (for other types of OCI registries).

### Optional

- `base_content_path` (String) The relative path to the endpoint specified.
- `endpoint_suffix` (String) Specifies a suffix to append to the endpoint. This field is optional, but some registries (e.g., JFrog) may require it. The final registry URL is constructed by appending this suffix to the endpoint.
- `is_synchronization` (Boolean) Specifies whether the registry is synchronized.
- `provider_type` (String) The type of provider used for interacting with the registry. Supported value's are `helm`, `zarf` and `pack`, The default is 'helm'. `zarf` is allowed with `type="basic"`
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `wait_for_status_message` (String) The status message from the last sync operation. This is a computed field that is populated after sync completes.
- `wait_for_sync` (Boolean) If `true`, Terraform will wait for the OCI registry to complete its initial synchronization before marking the resource as created or updated. This option is applicable when `provider_type` is set to `zarf` or `helm`. Default value is `false`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

Optional:

- `access_key` (String) The access key for accessing the registry. Required if 'credential_type' is set to 'secret'.
- `arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used for AWS-based authentication. Required if 'credential_type' is 'sts'.
- `external_id` (String) The external ID used for AWS STS (Security Token Service) authentication. Required if 'credential_type' is 'sts'.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password for basic authentication. Required if 'credential_type' is 'basic'.
- `secret_key` (String, Sensitive) The secret key for accessing the registry. Required if 'credential_type' is set to 'secret'.

### Nested Schema for `credentials.tls_config`

Optional:

- `certificate` (String) Specifies the TLS certificate used for secure communication. Required for enabling SSL/TLS encryption.
- `insecure_skip_verify` (Boolean) Disables TLS certificate verification when set to true. ⚠️ WARNING: Setting this to true disables SSL certificate verification and makes connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Only use this when connecting to registries with self-signed certificates in trusted networks.
