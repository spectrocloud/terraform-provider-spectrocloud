# spectrocloud_privatecloudgateway_ippool (Resource)

  A Resource to manage IP pools for Private Cloud Gateway.

You can learn more about Private Cloud Gateways IP Pools by revewing the [Create and Manage IPAM Node Pools](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/pcg/manage-pcg/create-manage-node-pool/) guide.

## Example Usage

An example of creating an IP Pool for a Private Cloud Gateway using a range of IP addresses and restricting the IP Pool to a single cluster.

```hcl
 data "spectrocloud_private_cloud_gateway" "pcg" {
   name = "wst-1-pcg"
 }

 resource "spectrocloud_privatecloudgateway_ippool" "ippool" {
   gateway                  = "192.168.1.1"
   name                     = "primary-compute-pool-1"
   network_type             = "range"
   prefix                   = "24"
   private_cloud_gateway_id = data.spectrocloud_private_cloud_gateway.pcg.id
   ip_start_range           = "192.168.1.10"
   ip_end_range             = "192.168.1.100"
   nameserver_addresses     = ["192.168.1.8"]
   restrict_to_single_cluster = true
 }
```


An example of creating an IP Pool for a Private Cloud Gateway using a subnet of IP addresses.

```hcl
 data "spectrocloud_private_cloud_gateway" "pcg" {
   name = "east-3-pcg"
 }

 resource "spectrocloud_privatecloudgateway_ippool" "ippool" {
   gateway                  = "10.10.192.1"
   name                     = "backup-compute-pool"
   network_type             = "subnet"
   prefix                   = "24"
   subnet_cidr              = "10.10.100.0/24"
   private_cloud_gateway_id = data.spectrocloud_private_cloud_gateway.pcg.id
   nameserver_addresses     = ["192.168.1.8"]
 }
```

## Schema

### Required

- `gateway` (String) The network gateway IP address for the IP pool. Typically, this is the default network gateway for the subnet.
- `name` (String) The name of the IP pool.
- `network_type` (String) The type of network for the IP pool. Allowed values are: `range` and `subnet`.
- `prefix` (Number) The prefix of the IP pool provided network range or subnet. For example `24` for a `/24` subnet or a range that falls inside a `24` subnet.
- `private_cloud_gateway_id` (String) The ID of the Private Cloud Gateway.

### Optional

- `ip_end_range` (String) The end IP address of the IP pool. Required if `network_type` is `range`.
- `ip_start_range` (String) The start IP address of the IP pool. Required if `network_type` is `range`.
- `nameserver_addresses` (Set of String) The list of nameserver IP addresses for the IP pool.
- `nameserver_search_suffix` (Set of String) The list of nameserver search suffixes for the IP pool. For example, `example.org`.
- `restrict_to_single_cluster` (Boolean) Restrict the IP pool to a single cluster. If set to `true`, the IP pool is restricted to a single cluster. We recommend setting this to `true` for production environments and creating separate IP pools for each cluster.
- `subnet_cidr` (String) The subnet CIDR of the IP pool. Required if `network_type` is `subnet`.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `delete` (String)
- `update` (String)
