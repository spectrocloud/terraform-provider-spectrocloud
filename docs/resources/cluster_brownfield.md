# spectrocloud_cluster_brownfield (Resource)

  Register an existing Kubernetes cluster (brownfield) with Palette. This resource allows you to import and manage existing Kubernetes clusters. Supported cloud platforms: (AWS, Azure, GCP, vSphere, OpenShift, Generic, Apache CloudStack, Edge Native, MAAS, and OpenStack). This feature is currently in preview.

~> **Preview Release**: The `spectrocloud_cluster_brownfield` resource provides the ability to import and register existing Kubernetes clusters across different cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, vSphere, OpenShift, Generic, Apache CloudStack, Edge Native, MAAS, and OpenStack) with Palette. This feature is currently **in preview**, and we are actively working on enhancements that will be released in future versions.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "spectrocloud_cluster_profile" "profile" {
  # id = <uid>
  name = var.cluster_cluster_profile_name
}

data "spectrocloud_backup_storage_location" "bsl" {
  name = var.backup_storage_location_name
}

resource "spectrocloud_cluster_brownfield" "cluster" {

## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import)
to import the resource spectrocloud_cluster_brownfield by using its `id` with the Palette `context` and `cloud_type` separated by colons. For example:

import {
  to = spectrocloud_cluster_brownfield.example
  id = "example_id:context:cloud_type"
}
```
Using `terraform import`, import the cluster using the `id` colon separated with `context` and `cloud_type`. For example:

```console
terraform import spectrocloud_cluster_brownfield.example cluster_uid:project:cloud_type 
```

Refer to the [Import section](/docs#import) to learn more.
