# spectrocloud_appliance (Resource)

  A resource for creating and managing appliances for Edge Native cluster provisioning.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "spectrocloud_appliance" "appliance" {
  uid = "test-dec9"
  tags = {
    "name" = "appliance_name"
  }
  wait = true
}
```

## Import

Appliances can be imported using the appliance UID. This is a project-level resource.

```bash
terraform import spectrocloud_appliance.example <appliance_uid>
```

Where `<appliance_uid>` is the appliance UID.

The import will automatically populate all configuration fields from the Spectro Cloud API, including the UID, tags, and tunnel configuration settings. The `wait` field will be set to `false` by default for imported appliances. After import, you can run `terraform plan` to see the current configuration and make any necessary adjustments.

**Note**: Since this is a project-level resource, ensure your provider is configured with appropriate project-level credentials and access.
