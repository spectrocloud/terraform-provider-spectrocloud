# spectrocloud_pack (Data Source)

  This data resource provides the ability to search for a pack in the Palette registries. It supports more advanced search criteria than the pack_simple data source.



~> The existing `filters` attribute will be deprecated, and a new `pack_filters` attribute will be introduced for advanced search functionality.

## Example Usage


An example of how to use this data source to retrieve a specific pack from the community registry.

```hcl
data "spectrocloud_registry" "community_registry" {
  name = "Palette Community Registry"
}


data "spectrocloud_pack" "hellouniverse" {
  name         = "hello-universe"
  version      = "1.1.2"
  registry_uid = data.spectrocloud_registry.community_registry.id
}
```


In this example, a filter is applied to retrieve a Calico CNI pack from the Palette OCI registry that is compatible with Edge clusters and has a version greater than 3.26.9.

-> The filter attribute is a string that can contain multiple filters separated by the `AND`, `OR` operator. You can filter for a pack by using the attributes retured in the `spec` object of the payload provided by the `v1/packs/search` endpoint.
Refer to the Palette Pack Search API endpoint [documentation](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/api/v1/v-1-packs-search/) for more information on the available filters.



```hcl
data "spectrocloud_registry" "palette_registry_oci" {
  name = "Palette Registry"
}


data "spectrocloud_pack" "cni" {
  filters = "spec.cloudTypes=edge-nativeANDspec.layer=cniANDspec.displayName=CalicoANDspec.version>3.26.9ANDspec.registryUid=${data.spectrocloud_registry.palette_registry_oci.id}"
}
```
