# Spectro Cloud Provider

The Spectro Cloud provider provides resources to interact with the Spectro Cloud management API (whether SaaS or on-prem).

## What is Spectro Cloud?

The Spectro Cloud management platform brings the managed Kubernetes experience to users' own unique enterprise
Kubernetes infrastructure stacks running in any public cloud, or private cloud environments, allowing users to
not have to trade-off between flexibility and manageability. Spectro Cloud provides an as-a-service experience
to users by automating the lifecycle of multiple Kubernetes clusters based on user-defined Kubernetes
infrastructure stacks.

## Spectro Cloud account

This provider requires access to a valid Spectro Cloud account. Sign up for a free trial account [here](https://www.spectrocloud.com/free-trial/).
You may use your Spectro Cloud account credentials to access the Spectro Cloud management API or a Spectro Cloud API key. For more details on the authentication, navigate to the [authentication](#authentication) section.

## Example Usage

Create a `providers.tf` file with the following:

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf"}}

Copy `terraform.template.tfvars` file to a `terraform.tfvars` file and modify its content:

{{tffile "examples/provider/terraform.template.tfvars"}}

->
Be sure to populate the `sc_host`, `sc_api_key`, and other terraform vars.

Copy one of the resource configuration files (e.g: spectrocloud_cluster_profile) from the _Resources_ documentation. Be sure to specify
all required parameters.

Next, run terraform using:

    terraform init && terraform apply

Detailed schema definitions for each resource are listed in the _Resources_ menu on the left.
