# Terraform Provider spectrocloud

Terraform Provider for Spectro Cloud.

## Usage

For an end end-to-end example of cluster provisioning, take a look at the [examples/e2e/](examples/e2e/) directory. If your cloud of choice, doesn't
have an end-to-end example, review the corresponding _cluster_ example in [examples/resources/](examples/resources/).

Additionally, detailed documentation on supported data sources and resources are available on the
[Terraform Spectro Cloud Provider Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spectrocloud/spectrocloud/latest/docs).


## Build provider

Run the following command to build the provider

```shell
$ go build -o terraform-provider-spectrocloud
```
